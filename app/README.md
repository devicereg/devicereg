> A Vue.js project

This is the normal Vue.js template for a new project containing webpack, 
ESLint, Nodemon and many more...

## Important Note for nodemon
If you are using a common Unix distribution you might find it useful to deactivate
the nodemon `legacyWatch` mode.
This is done by commenting/removing the relevant line in `nodemon.json`


Please make sure that you don't commit those changes...

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
